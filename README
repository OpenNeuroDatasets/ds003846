### Prediction Error EEG & Motion Study
This is the dataset of the study "prediction error". In short, 19 participants were tested in a virtual reality (VR) reach-to-object task. In the task participants experienced visual, visual with vibrotactile or visual with vibrotactile (all subjects) and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) feedback (10 subjects) . In 25% of trials the feedback, 'button selection', was provided prematurely, resulting in prediction error / mismatch ERPs (oddball style paradigm). Participants rated their interactive experience on the Immersion and Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) and their workload on the NASA-TLX.

### Available Data
Data include `64 channel EEG + 1 reference` and `12 channel Motion` (6DOF right hand, 6DOF head). Motion metadata is formatted to current preliminary [BIDS Motion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaaLKgWjK5pcISD1MVxHKexB3PZWfE2aAC5HF_pCZWo/edit), see [how to get involved](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification).

### Data Format and Derivation
Original data were recorded in `.xdf` format using [labstreaminglayer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer). A `\sourcedata` directory is currently missing since our `.xdf` files did not comply with GDPR.
